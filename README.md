# Movie Kiosk – A Movie Renting System

You are a Software Engineer at a Movie Rental company and you
have been asked to write the software for their latest piece of
technology, a fully automated movie renting system.

This is one of latest strategies implemented by the company that
aims to increase profits and makes their products more accessible
to their customer base.

However, they are struggling to find a capable programmer that can
build a robust application that is fully functional and easy to use.

This requirement is urgent, as competitor companies have heard
the rumors of this state-of-the-art system and they have also started
working on similar prototypes.


## Specification:

The Movie Renting System (or Movie Kiosk) will consist of two main components, an administrative component, and a movie catalogue. 
The administrative section will allow, through text-based menus, the addition and removal of customers, the addition and removal of movies in the catalogue, the display of customer records, the display of a customer’s 3 favorite movies and the top-up of customer accounts. 

The catalogue will store a list of all the movies in the kiosk, a list of the genres of those movies, and a list of the available movies.  The catalogue will also allow display of the movies in a number of ways, including by availability, genre and year. Finally, the catalogue will also handle the renting and return of movies. 

Each customer record will include the customer’s name, their chosen ID number, their current balance, which movies they are currently renting and their full renting history. 

Each movie record will include the movie’s title, its genre and the year in which it was made.
